#ACDC - Datacenter layout application

Developed to enable datacenter techs and other staff to view and edit datacenter layouts. The application allows the user to add, move, & delete racks. Clicking on a rack displays a front view in a right-hand panel showing accurate devices by querying a ServiceNow CMDB.
